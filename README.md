TM App - Open Source App Hosted on ECS with Terraform ðŸš€
========================================================

This project deploys the TM App, based on Amazon's [Threat Composer Tool](https://github.com/aws-samples/threat-composer), an open-source application for threat modeling and security assessments. The app is securely hosted at [https://najiib.co.uk](https://najiib.co.uk) on AWS ECS using Terraform, featuring an HTTPS-enabled architecture with AWS-managed resources for scalability, security, and resilience.

Project Overview
----------------

The deployment is fully automated using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and follows containerization best practices with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Elastic Container Service (ECS). A GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline handles continuous integration and deployment for a seamless workflow.

### Key Features

*   **Automated Infrastructure**: Terraform modules provision and manage AWS resources.
    
*   **Containerized Deployment**: App image built and stored in ECR.
    
*   **HTTPS Security**: Secure access to the app via SSL/TLS using ACM.
    
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Deployed on ECS with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for load balancing.
    

Infrastructure Overview
-----------------------

This project utilizes the following AWS resources:

*   **Amazon ECS**: Manages the TM app's containerized services.
    
*   **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Distributes HTTPS traffic securely to ECS tasks.
    
*   **Amazon Route 53**: Manages DNS and domain routing.
    
*   **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: Manages SSL certificates for HTTPS.
    

### Project Architecture

The infrastructure consists of a custom VPC, ECS Cluster, Security Groups, and ACM for TLS. Route 53 configures DNS to route traffic securely to the TM App hosted on ECS. (Refer to architecture\_diagram.png for details.)

Deployment Instructions
-----------------------

### Prerequisites

*   **AWS CLI** with necessary permissions
    
*   **Docker** for local containerization
    
*   **Terraform** to manage IaC
    

### Deployment Steps

1.  bashCopy codegit clone cd
    
2.  bashCopy codedocker build -t tm-app .docker tag tm-app:latest /tm-app:latestdocker push /tm-app:latest
    
3.  bashCopy codeterraform initterraform apply
    
4.  **Access Application**:Visit [https://najiib.co.uk](https://najiib.co.uk) to access the live TM App.
    

Local Development
-----------------

1.  bashCopy codeyarn install
    
2.  bashCopy codeyarn buildserve -s build
    
3.  **Access Locally**:Open [http://localhost:3000/workspaces/default/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/workspaces/default/dashboard) to view the app locally.
    

CI/CD Pipeline
--------------

The GitHub Actions workflow automates CI/CD for this project. The main jobs include:

*   **Docker Build & Push**: Builds and deploys images to ECR on main branch updates.
    
*   **Terraform Apply**: Applies infrastructure changes upon updates.
